\textbf{{\large Introduction}}\\ \\
Financial analysts often times do not have a clear cut idea about ithe behaviour of the stock market which often times appears unpredictable. Maximizing profits is very difficult due to the reason of this unpredictability We could better predict the market if we could analyze historical data. This is where machine learning could play a role.it is cumbersome or often times impossible to manually analyze the huge amount historical data. Modern hardware
and software can easily process this tremendous amount of data using machine learning. It can find patterns in this huge amount of data thus helping investors invest more wisely and garner more profits. As Historical data is freely available on the Internet, the main problem we are facing is to apply suitable machine learning techniques for stock data and predict their trends with accuracies greater than 50\% in the long term.
